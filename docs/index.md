Misti is a static analysis tool designed for smart contracts on the [TON blockchain](https://ton.org/).

## Language Support
- [Tact](https://tact-lang.org/) is supported
- [FunC](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/overview) support is [planned](https://github.com/nowarp/misti/issues/56) by the end of the year

## Features
- **Code Analysis**: Identify and fix potential [security flaws and code problems](https://nowarp.io/tools/misti/docs/detectors) early in the development cycle.
- **CI/CD Integration**:
  [Integrate](https://nowarp.io/tools/misti/docs/tutorial/ci-cd) Misti into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous code quality checks.
- **Custom Detectors**: Create [custom detectors](https://nowarp.io/tools/misti/docs/hacking/custom-detector) to solve specific problems in your code or to provide a thorough security review if you are an auditor.

## Name Origin
The name "Misti" comes from the Misti volcano in Peru. It was chosen because it's catchy and easy to remember.

## Funding
Misti has been funded by the following [TON Foundation](https://ton.foundation) grants:
* [TON Static Analyzer · #436](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/436)
* [Upgrade Misti with Advanced Tact Detectors · #777](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/777)
