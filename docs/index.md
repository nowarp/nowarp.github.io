  [Integrate](https://nowarp.io/tools/misti/docs/tutorial/ci-cd) Misti into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous code quality checks.
- **Custom Detectors**: Create [custom detectors](https://nowarp.io/tools/misti/docs/hacking/custom-detector) to solve specific problems in your code or to provide a thorough security review if you are an auditor.
