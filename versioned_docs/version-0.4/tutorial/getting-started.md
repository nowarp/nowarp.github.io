# Getting started
This guide will walk you through the steps to install and set up the Misti static analyzer.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Git
- Yarn
- Node.js version 22 or higher
- [Souffl√©](https://souffle-lang.github.io/install)

## Installation
Misti is distributed via npm and should be added to your Tact project [in the same way](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) as Tact itself:
```bash
yarn add @nowarp/misti
```

### Using Development Version
The latest development version may be unstable, yet it includes all the recently added detectors and therefore can provide a more comprehensive analysis.

To install the latest development version you should:
1. Clone Misti: `git clone https://github.com/nowarp/misti`
2. Build it: `cd misti && yarn install && yarn build`
3. Use it in your Tact project: `cd /path/to/tact/project && yarn add file:/path/to/misti`

## Running the analysis
Run Misti by specifying a Tact project configuration:
```
npx misti path/to/tact.config.json
```

This will highlight any warnings the analyzer found.

You can also add a script to your `package.json` to simplify running the linting process:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "npx misti path/to/tact.config.json"
  }
}
```

## More usage examples

Below are a few usage examples for common scenarios when using [the `misti` CLI](./cli.md).

### Suppressing Specific Detectors

To run `misti` while suppressing specific detectors, such as `ReadOnlyVariables`:

```bash
npx misti --suppress ReadOnlyVariables path/to/tact.config.json
```

### Enabling All Detectors

Running `misti` with all available built-in detectors enabled:

```bash
npx misti --all-detectors path/to/tact.config.json
```

It is recommended to do that when auditing the project.

### Running in Quiet Mode

To suppress all output while running `misti` getting just a return code:

```bash
npx misti --quiet path/to/tact.config.json
```

This might be useful in scripts and CI/CD.

## Troubleshooting
